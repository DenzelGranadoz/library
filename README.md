# Library
This is a library project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library) created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, topics includes the use of objects and constructors. 
* I will add media queries later on

[Check it out!](https://DenzelGranadoz.github.io/library)

### Stuff I've learned
* Objects and Constructors
* Improved my knowledge on DOM Manipulation as I feel more comfortable with it
* Manipulating styles through use of child or sibling selectors
* Better grasp on Grid
* How to save data to localstorage
* Got more familiar with array methods of JS

### My thoughts on this project
Overall, it was a stressful yet fun experience as I went for a minimalist design and im satisfied with how it turned out. Javascript had me questioning life decisions as usual plus I haven't coded with JS in a while so my code is all over the place, spaghetti code at its finest. I'm just happy I managed to finish even thought im a few days behind on schedule. For future projects, I hope to do better in terms of organizing my code and practice clean coding more.
